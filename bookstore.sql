detours through the annals of human civilization and scientific discovery.<br><br>
Enter critically acclaimed writer and popular journalist Victoria Finlay, who here takes readers across the globe and over 
the centuries on an unforgettable tour through the brilliant history of color in art. Written for newcomers 
to the subject and aspiring young artists alike, Finlay’s quest to uncover the origins and science of color will

for instance, purple might not have become the royal color of the Western world. Without Napoleon, the black graphite pencil

And were it not for the pigment cobalt blue, the halls of museums worldwide might still be filled with forged Vermeers.<br><br>
